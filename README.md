Welcome to my ADHD collection of projects.
</p>

- 🧠 This GitHub is basically my digital workshop  
- 🔬 It contains school projects, random experiments, and tech ideas I couldn’t let go  
- ⚙️ If I ever wonder “how does this actually work?” it usually ends up here  
- 🚀 Currently exploring embedded systems and web development  
- 🎣 Fun fact: I disappear into nature when the code stops compiling

### What you'll find here

Mostly:
- Embedded systems (C / C++)
- MATLAB simulations
- Python experiments
- Web projects
- The occasional neural network attempt

Some projects are polished.  
Some are messy.  
All of them taught me something.
